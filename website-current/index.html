		<h2>Imola</h2>
		<p>The circuit is in an area with long associations with speed – as far back as 80BC the Romans created an amphitheatre for gladiatorial chariot racing. In more recent times, the idea for a motor racing circuit was first promoted in the late 1940s.
		The first racing events were held in April 1953, with the GP Coni motorcycle race which was approved for the 125cc and 500cc Italian championship. The following year the first car races arrived in the form of the Coppa d'Oro Shell.</p>

		<p>Initially named after the Santerno River which borders it on the paddock side, the circuit was renamed Autodromo Dino Ferrari in 1970 after Enzo Ferrari's son, who had died of leukaemia in 1956. Enzo Ferrari's own name was added following his death in 1988.</p>
		
		<p>The first major layout revision came in August 1972, with the construction of the Variente Bassa (lower) chicane, and from 1974 the Variente Alta (higher) chicane was also added to slow speeds on the approach to Rivazza. Into the mid 1970s, Imola was still a collection of public and private roads, but the decision was taken at the end of the decade to formalise affairs and create a true permanent facility for the first time. Roads were closed off to public traffic and construction work around the circuit saw it emerge with barriers all round, grandstands and new pit buildings. The reward was a Forumla One Grand Prix – initially a non-championship affair in 1979, won by the Brabham of Niki Lauda – and then in 1980, the Italian Grand Prix was awarded to Imola following a dispute with organisers at the Monza circuit. From 1981, Imola was granted a race alongside Monza under the guise of the nearby Republic of San Marino, an event it would host for the next quarter century.</p>

		<h3>Getting There</h3>
		<p>The Autodromo Enzo e Dino Ferrari is located on the southern outskirts of the city of Imola in north-central Italy. Imola itself is within 5 miles of the A14 highway, whih links it to Bologna (25 miles) and Modena (53 miles). Ferrari's base at Maranello is a short distance from Modena, while Torro Rosso's Faenza factory is 10 miles south east on the A14.</p>
		
		<p>The nearest international airport is at Bologna, while Rimini Airport is 55 miles away and offers scheduled flights to Russia and Albania.</p>
		
		<p>Arrival by train is also straightforward, as Imola's main station is a short distance away.</p> -->

					<h3>Ferrari F8 Tributo</h3>
					<p>its twin-turbocharged V8 now develops 710bhp and 568lb ft, and surprise surprise, it’s as devastatingly fast as ever. It might still lack some of the aural drama of the 458’s old naturally aspirated V8, but the introduction of a new Hot Tube Resonator helps pipe a dash more noise into the cabin. Variable Boost Management ramps up torque gradually, too, so it not only feels more like a non-turbo engine, but cuts turbo-lag to almost non-existent levels, too.

					It’s chassis is the main attraction, however. Not only does it make the engine’s stratospheric performance accessible, it also endows the Tributo with otherworldly levels of agility, balance and handling panache. Make no mistake, this is a sensational supercar. It’ll take a full road test to see whether it’ll topple the 720S, mind. Watch this space.</p>

					<h3>Lamborghini Aventador SVJ</h3>
					<p>A drive in Sant’Agata’s twelve 12-cylinder, mid-engined series-production flagship supercar is not something you’ll forget. The Aventador’s line goes all the way back through Murcielago, Diablo and Countach to the legendary Miura – and it’s a car with the stunning looks and full-blooded naked aggression to hold its own, even in comparison with its ancestors.

					The engine in the SVJ 759bhp at 8500rpm is stupendous, even if its paddleshift transmission isn’t always worthy of it. It does feel hugely wide on the road, and is still a sledgehammer of an instrument on the track, although it’s developed greater handling delicacy and balance in later life. As for drama? Off the scale.</p>

					<h3>McLaren 720S</h3>
					<p>The McLaren 720S has succeeded where both of its predecessors (650S and MP4-12C) fell short in our supercar class chart: purely and simply, by topping it.

					There are few more direct or effective ways for cars in this stratum of the performance car market to demonstrate their superiority than by accelerating faster, lapping quicker and stopping harder than any rival: the 720S does all three. In many of the performance benchmarks road testers are used to measuring, in fact, this 710bhp blockbuster is a closer match for a contemporary hypercar than one of its mid-engined opponents.</p>
